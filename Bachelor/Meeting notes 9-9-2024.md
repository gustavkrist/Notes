## Questions

- Flesch reading ease score ranges from 0-100, Fleisch-Kincaid gives a number that is meant to be a US grade
  - Which one should I try to find adaptations for?

## Notes

- Look into usage restrictions on the EFCAMDAT
- Look for more datasets
- Look for papers with the main focus of readability in a given language
  - Maybe not FK adaptations but then a good readability metric for the language
